Programming Theory Submission

This is a project for Unity Learn
https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-programming-theory-in-action

Note: All code is in "Programming-Theory-Project/Assets/Scripts"

This main objective is to create a game that shows the following OOP principles:

-Abstraction: reducing duplicate code by “abstracting out” repeated details or information.
-Encapsulation: “encapsulating” data and the methods that manipulate that data together in a class, protecting it from misuse by other classes.
-Inheritance: child classes deriving (or “inheriting”) behavior from parent classes.
-Polymorphism: changing (“morphing”) methods into many (“poly”) forms (i.e., method overloading and method overriding).

For a succesful submission:

-A link to your project’s GitHub repo, showing multiple commits with commit messages and at least two branches
-Demonstration of abstraction (higher-level methods that abstract unnecessary details)
-Demonstration of inheritance (parent/child classes)
-Demonstration of polymorphism (method overriding or overloading)
-Demonstration of encapsulation (getters and setters)
